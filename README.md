# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their medical and lifestyle data. By using various machine learning algorithms, we aim to build an accurate model that helps in early diagnosis and preventive care for heart disease.

## Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms are used to build and compare models for heart disease prediction:

1. **Logistic Regression (LR)** - A binary classification algorithm that estimates the probability of heart disease presence based on input features.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - A non-parametric method that classifies cases based on the majority vote of the nearest neighbors in the feature space.
3. **Decision Tree (DT)** - A tree-structured model that splits data based on feature values to make decisions, allowing for interpretable classification.
4. **Random Forest** - An ensemble of decision trees that combines multiple tree results to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
